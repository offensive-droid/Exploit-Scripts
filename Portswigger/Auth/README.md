# Portswigger Lab: Broken brute-force protection, IP block
<img src="pitchfork-auth.png">
I used this to make my mutated wordlist since every 4 unsuccessful login attempts it locks me out for 1 min. <br> 
To bypass this i have to login with `wiener:peter` and then login with carlos again & again to be able to bruteforce this login page.
